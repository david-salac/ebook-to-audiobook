Author: David Salac

## Usage
1. Install all dependencies in `requirements.txt`.
2. Set environmental variables:
   1. `PATH_TO_BOOK_TXT` <=> PATH TO THE TXT FILE TO BE READ
   2. `PATH_TO_OUTPUT_WAV` <=> PATH TO THE WAV THAT IS GENERATED
3. Run `main.py`.

## Note
The algorithm runs for a while - couple of hours - depending on your computer.
